## Viewing Scenes with WebXR

vtk.js supports virtual reality rendering via the [WebXR device API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/) for most standalone and PC headsets.

Developers seeking to develop VR experiences without hardware may make use of the Mozilla WebXR emulator extension at [https://github.com/MozillaReality/WebXR-emulator-extension](https://github.com/MozillaReality/WebXR-emulator-extension) with these installation steps:

- Install the WebXR extension on either Chrome or Firefox.
- Close and reopen the browser.
- Press F12 to access the browser console.
- Select the "WebXR" tab to selected XR emulated hardware and view controls.
