### WebXR Example with Realistic Rendering - Hybrid Shading

This is an XR example with hybrid shading effect, a mixture of gradient and partial volumetric shadow. Depending on internet speed, it would take 15 sec - 1 min to load the data. It can be deployed with mobile AR or VR, thought frame rate is likely to be low for mobile AR rendering.
